#Example Swift Apps
####Collection of example applications written in Swift 2.x for iOS 9.x (developed under 9.2.1-9.3.1 SDK using Xcode 7.2.1/7.3+)

To help assist other developers working on transitioning from Hybrid Applications or Android development to Swift.

Completed examples will include reusable classes for UI components (sound, animation, rounded buttons or blur effects), basic games, map views, api handling (json), user authentication, and much more.

##Requirements: 

#####XCode 7.3+ (latest update) on El Capitan. Apple Developer License.

You should have a working understanding of basic variables, arrays, loops, and so forth. If not, consult the playground files that have been added to help assist you in quickly getting up to speed. Each app will be increasingly more complex. Some samples will be posted onto the App Store for trial on your personal device.
