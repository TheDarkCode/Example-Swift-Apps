#Example Swift Apps
Collection of example applications written in Swift / Objective-C for iOS 9.x (developed under 9.2.1 SDK - will be migrated to 9.3 when released)

To help assist other developers working on transitioning from Hybrid Applications or Android development to Swift / Objective-C.

Completed examples will include reusable classes for UI components (sound, animation, rounded buttons or blur effects), basic games, a calculator, map views, api handling (json), and much more.

Requirements: XCode 7 (latest update) on El Capitan. Apple Developer License.

You should have a working understanding of basic variables, arrays, loops, and so forth. If not, consult the playground files that have been added to help assist you in quickly getting up to speed. Each app will be increasingly more complex. Some samples will be posted onto the App Store for trial on your personal device.

#####NOTE: While there may be a general license applied to the repo as a whole, you should not assume all media (example project assets like images or videos) are under that same license. Creative commons and open source images are used throughout with attributions given inside each relevant project's files; however, copyright or trademark use allowances or restrictions can be changed by authors and may not be accurately reflected in the repo. As a rule of thumb, you should use the provided samples only as guides to help you learn, not as commercial assets to use in your new app on the App Store. For example, sample project assets like the dryverless logo are not under the MIT license.
